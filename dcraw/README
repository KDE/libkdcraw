DCRAW BACKPORT.
-----------------------------

The dcraw.c file must be updated periodicly to support new RAW files format.
The current implementation can be found at this url:

http://cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/dcraw.c

Following lines need to be changed in dcraw.c :

==> With "-i -v" options to report Make and Model indentification properlly using separate lines 
    on the console a printf need to be added like this:

int CLASS main (int argc, char **argv)
{
...
      /* NOTE: Digikam Fix : separate output of "make" and "model" informations.
      printf ("Camera: %s %s\n", make, model); */
      printf ("Make: %s\n", make);
      printf ("Model: %s\n", model);
...
}

These informations are used by DcrawIface class to give some metadata with Exiv2 unsupported 
RAW file format.
