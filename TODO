- Add DNG writting mode support using Adobe DNG sdk

- Libraw 0.13.0 features to support :

1) The exposure correction code is controlled by three variables in params. structure:

   int exp_correc; - positive value enables exposure correction. Default is 0 (correction disabled)
   float exp_shift; - exposure shift in *linear* scale.
   float exp_preser; - amount of highlight preservation for 'positive' (e.g. > 1.0) exposure correction

Usable range for exp_shift is  from 0.5 (darken image 1 stop) to 3.0 (lighten ~1.5 photographic stops).
Usable range for exp_preser is from 0.0 (linear exposure shift, highlights may blow) to 1.0 (maximum highlights preservation, upper half of S-curve applied to image)

2) Line noise (banding correction). May be used with any interpolation method.

   int caline; - boolean, non-zero turns on the correction
   float linenoise; - amount of cleaning. Range between 0.001 and 0.02, commonly 0.005

3) Impulse noise cleaning. Again, all interpolation methods

   int cfa_clean; Boolean 0/non-zero. Default is 0 (off)
   fload lclean,cclean;  (L)uminance and (C)olor amount of cleaning. Range between 0.005 and 0.05, commonly 0.01

4) Green channel local averaging. All interpolation methods, but may conflict with green_matching option, so it is safer to use only one green averaging.

   int cfa_green; Boolean, default is 0 (off)
   float green_threshold;  - Sensitivity of method (green is averaged if difference less than this value in percent).  Usable range between 0.01 and 0.1, commonly 0.03

This filtering is applied *before* demosaic.

The problem is simple: on some cameras (for example, Olympus E-xxx) two green channels are different (in sensitivity and, may be, in spectral response). 
As a result, it produces 'maze artifacts' on flat surfaces (like sky).
The solution is simple: if two channels are *slightly* different in some local area, it is better to equalize it.
