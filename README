-- ABOUT -------------------------------------------------------------

Libkdcraw is a C++ interface around LibRaw library used to decode RAW
picture files. More information about LibRaw can be found at http://www.libraw.org.

This library is used by kipi-plugins, digiKam and others kipi host programs.

The library documentation is available on header files.

-- DEPENDENCIES -------------------------------------------------------

CMake      >= 2.4.3                    http://www.cmake.org
libqt      >= 4.2.x                    http://www.qtsoftware.com
libkde     >= 4.0.x                    http://www.kde.org
liblcms    >= 1.14.x (used by libraw)  http://www.littlecms.com

Optional :

libjpeg    >= 8      (used by libraw)  http://www.ijg.org
libjasper  >= 1.7.x  (used by libraw)  http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper8
libxml2    >= 2.7.x  (used by libraw)  http://xmlsoft.org
libgomp    >= 4.3.x  (used by libraw)  http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/gomp

Note: OpenMP support is hightly recommended to speed-up RAW demosaicing
operations using parallelized code.

Note: all library dependencies require development and binary packages installed on your
computer to compile digiKam.

CMake compilation option de customized for libkdcraw:

Use CMake "-ENABLE_LCMS2=on"     flag to link libraw to LCMS2 else LCMS1         (disabled by default).
Use CMake "-ENABLE_RAWSPEED=on"  flag to compile libraw with RawSpeed codec      (disabled by default).

-- INSTALL ------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile, especially when QT3/Qt4 are installed at the same time, 
just use something like that:

# export VERBOSE=1
# export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt4/  
# export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH 
# cmake .
# make

Usual CMake options :

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : decide where the program will be install on your computer.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     : decide which type of build you want. You can chose between "debugfull", "debug", "profile", "relwithdebinfo" and "release". The default is "relwithdebinfo" (-O2 -g).

Compared to old KDE3 autoconf options:

"cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull" is equivalent to "./configure --enable-debug=full"
"cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr"  is equivalent to "./configure --prefix=/usr"

More details can be found ata this url: http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/CMake#Environment_Variables

Note: To know KDE install path on your computer, use 'kde-config --prefix' command line like this (with full debug object enabled):

"cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`"
